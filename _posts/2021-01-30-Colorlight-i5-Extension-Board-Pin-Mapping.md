The Colorlight i5 extension board doesn't come with a connector pin to FPGA pin diagram, so I
made one myself. The mapping has been been derived from the [board schematic](https://github.com/wuxx/Colorlight-FPGA-Projects/tree/master/schematic)
on the [official extension board GitHub repo](https://github.com/wuxx/Colorlight-FPGA-Projects).

**Use at your own risk! Errors may have crept in while crossreferencing pin locations!**
