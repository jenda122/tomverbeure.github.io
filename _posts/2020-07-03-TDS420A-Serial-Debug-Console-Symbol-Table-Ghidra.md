# Introduction

With [the firmware extracted](/2020/07/02/Extracting-the-Tektronix-TDS420A-Firmware.html),
it's now time to dig deeper by connecting to the scope's RS-232 debug interface to a PC 
and see what we find.

# Connecting to TDS 420A RS-232 Debug Console Port

Like most Tektronix oscilloscopes of that era, my TDS 420A has an external RS-232 port 
(Option 13). However, it can only be used for the HardCopy feature, where you connect 
the scope to an ancient printer to dump screenshots.

But that's not the only RS-232 port! Next to the firmware update switches
on the CPU PCB, you can find a 10-pin connector that carries the RS-232 port
for the debug and diagnostic console. 

To access this port, you need to remove the cover of the scope: just remove
5 torx screws and you're good. 

![Scope Naked](/assets/tds420a/scope_naked.jpg)

**Important reminder: not only are there 110V circuits in the scope, there's also
a CRT that requires much higher voltages! Don't even think about randomly touching
things in there unless you know what you're doing!!!**

Tektronix used to sell a cable to convert the 10-pin header into a standard DB9 serial 
port connector, but I had a much better idea:

The external RS-232 DB9 connector of the HardCopy plug-in board *also* goes to a 
10-pin header. If I removed the 10-pin-to-DB9-cable from that PCB, and connected it 
to the 10-pin header of the CPU PCB, then surely that would allow me to connect the debug 
port to a regular DB9 serial cable.

![Hardcopy Plug-In Board](/assets/tds420a/hardcopy_board.jpg)

Because, surely, the Tektronix wouldn't be so dumb to have different pinouts for
the external RS-232 to DB9 cable and the internal one?

Well, I tried that, and it didn't work, because Tektronix was indeed *that* dumb.
The debug console cable is rotated by 180 degrees compared to the external cable.

After wasting a perfectly good half hour on this, I connected the thing up with some
flimsy wires. Make sure you configure it in null modem configuration: the RX on
the PC must be connected to the TX of the scope and vice versa.

![RS232 Annotated Pins](/assets/tds420a/rs232_annotated.jpg)

There is no need to wire up any of the RS-232 flow control pins. TXD and RXD are
sufficient.

![Serial Port Connection](/assets/tds420a/serial_port_connection.jpg)

Armed with a USB to RS-232 converter, I used `picocom -b 9600 /dev/ttyUSB0`, and
the following characters rolled on the screen after powering up the scope:

```
	Bootrom Header Checksum passed.
	Bootrom Total Checksum passed.
	BootRom Check Sum passed.

	Bus Error Write to Bootrom passed.

# The VxWorks Operating System

In my previous blog post, I already came across the VxWorks logo in the main firmware dump.

[VxWorks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VxWorks) is a popular real-time operating system (RTOS) 
for embedded systems with real-time constraints. An oscilloscope is a very good
example of that.

It supports a large amount of CPUs (the TDS 420A has a Motorola 68020), has a preemptive 
multitasking kernel, file systems, network protocol stacks etc. The OS can run a large
number of different tasks with different priority.

One of those tasks is the console command shell, which allows us to enter
commands, get status information, start, suspend, and kill tasks etc.

Typing the `i` command lists all the tasks that are running the scope, sorted by
priority.

```

```

`help` is a good starting point to see what you can do from the shell, but
it only scratches the surface about what's possible. That's because console shell
allows calling *any* function that is declared in the symbol table as if it's a native 
console command.

You have no idea how useful that is if you want to inspect the internals of a system: 
all the functions that 
[I found through the `strings main_fw.bin` command](/2020/07/02/Extracting-the-Tektronix-TDS420A-Firmware.html#strings-in-the-main-firmware)
can be called and executed in a live working environment!

Here's a simple example: there is `ringBell()` function in the firmware. When I type `ringBell`
on the console... the bell rings.

**VxWorks in combination with a shell and a symbol table is a massive firmware reverse engineering 
cheat code.**

# Creating a Full Symbol Table

The most useful function of all is `lkup`: it checks if a given string matches any part
of the strings in the symbol table, and prints out these matching symbols with their corresponding
address. 

For example, `lkup "_a"` give the following list:

```
_atBusAddrTest  0x0117dba8 text
_activateElement 0x0119b820 text
_attnDecadeDivCh1 0x0115464e text
_acquiredWfms   0x02e98380 bss
_auxDescBuf     0x02e55af0 bss
_set_if_addr    0x011f1032 text
_attnSigPathCh4 0x011543d4 text
_arpinput       0x011eff26 text
_asctime        0x0119adba text
_m_adj          0x011f57e8 text
_adgMemShortDiag 0x01185528 text
_atBusTest      0x0117ddd0 text
_attnSigPathCh1 0x01154344 text
_aliasNameBufList 0x02e56450 bss
_asciiPoint     0x02e577c0 bss
...
_xdr_attrstat   0x011e5750 text
...
```

*Note how the list includes `_xdr_attrstat` because it has `_a` in the middle of the string.*

With `lkup`, I could dump all the symbols in the binary to create a symbol table that can
be used in binary code analysis tools such as Ghidra or 
IDA Pro.

Instead of dumping them all at once, I went from `_a` to `_z` and from `_A` to `_Z`. The end 
result were 5000+ symbols and their address.

# Ghidra, a Binary Code Analysis Tool

[Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org/) is an open source binary code analysis tool that was released 
about 1 year ago by the [NSA](https://www.nsa.gov/), believe it or not. 
[IDA Pro](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/) and [IDA Home](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/idahome/) 
are the commercial (expensive!) equivalent of Ghidra.

A binary code analysis tool is essentially a smart disassembler that takes in a pure binary 
dump, identifies machine code segments and data such as strings and pointers, converts them to 
low level C code, cross references calls from one function to the other, creates call graphs etc.

Even without a symbol table, tools like this can go a long way in uncovering the secrets
of firmware, but add one to the mix, and major parts of the the firmware become an open
book.

# Diving Deep into the TDS 420A Firmware with Ghidra

I have never used a binary code analysis tool before, but I had heard great things about
Ghidra and I was eager to give it a try. Ghidra has support for a large number of CPUs,
even ancient ones like the 68020.

Long story short: Ghidra is amazing. In 15 minutes, I went from downloading the tool to browsing
through the TDS 420A firmware, jumping in and out of layers of function calls and being
productive with it.

Just follow these steps:

1. Start the tool with `ghidraRun`
1. Create a new project
1. File -> Import File -> `main_fw.bin` -> Select File To Import
1. Language -> 68000 / MC68020 Variant
1. Option -> Base Address -> 0x01000000
1. Ok

![Ghidra main_fw.bin Imported](/assets/tds420a/ghidra_import.png)

After double clicking `main_fw.bin`, you'll be asked if the newly imported binary should
analyzed. Of course, it should! After waiting half a minute, you'll be greeted with 
thousands of anonymous C functions in the Symbol Tree window.

I could now load the symbol table that I created earlier, which replaced
many of these unnamed functions by named ones. Here's how you go about importing this table 
into Ghidra:

* Window -> Script Manager
* Select 'Data' in the Scripts list
* Double click on 'ImportSymbolsScript.py'

![Import Symbols Script](/assets/tds420a/import_symbols_script.png)

Now select the symbol table file, and 5000+ of functions that were previously
anonymous will suddenly reveal their name.

The `ringBell` function that I executed earlier on the debug console gets decompiled
to this:

![ringBell decompiled](/assets/tds420a/ring_bell.png)

There are plenty of Ghidra tutorials on the web, but I have yet to read one of them.
A few tactical Google searches were needed to discover the way to set the firmware
based address to 0x01000000, or to figure out now to import the symbol table, 
but other than that Ghidra UI is intuitive enough to get many things done by just
trying things out.

That said, it's certain that I haven't even scratched the surface of what's possible!

# When You Don't Have a Symbol Table...

Based on all of the above, one might think that a symbol table is necessary to get
useful information out of a binary executable. Nothing could be further from the
truth.

I did the Ghidra exercise on the boot ROM, and the result were still impressive: 
it's a bit more of puzzle where one discovery will lead to the next.

The most important breadcrumbs are embedded strings.

When the scope is in firmware update mode, the RS-232 debug console is output-only.
Here's the full log after booting up:

```
	Bootrom Header Checksum passed.
	Bootrom Total Checksum passed.
	BootRom Check Sum passed.
	Bus Error Timeout test passed.
	Bus Error Write to Bootrom passed.
	GPIB Test passed.
Kernel Diagnostics Complete.

Calling SDM (monitor) Routine.

SDM (monitor) not enabled.
	Enabling Bus Control register. Value = 0x2
+12V applied to Flashroms

Flashrom Programming Voltage is ON.
Cannot transfer control to Flashrom.
Transferring control to the SDM (monitor).
```

After importing the boot ROM binary into Ghidra, there were many bytes sequences
that are obviously executable code, but Ghidra didn't identify them as such.

I manually started telling Ghidra to disassemble these byte sequences ("Disassemble")
and convert them into functions.

Eventually I hit the jackpot, with a function that reverse compiled
into the following C code:

![Bootrom Log Messages](/assets/tds420a/bootrom_log_messages.png)

There is so much to learn from this!

* `FUN_0000166C` is obviously a `print` function.
* `FUN_000034e8` must be running a 68901 test.
* `FUN_00002c52` must be doing a boot ROM checksum

and so forth.

You just rename the functions into something that's human readable, and dive in
in search for more.

This is the same code as above, but with the functions renamed. Looks much better!

![Renamed boot ROM functions](/assets/tds420a/renamed_bootrom_functions.png)

How could we use this for our scope?

A good example is the `test_bootrom_checksum()` function: it only takes a little
bit of effort to figure our the checksum algorithm (it's a sum), locate where
the expected value is read from, and the address range over which the checksum is 
calculated.

Once you know that, you could patch the boot ROM, or the main firmware, any way
you want, calculate the correct firmware, and flash it into the scope using
`tektool`.

# That GPIB Address 29 in Firmware Update Mode

For fun, I wanted to see if I could find the place where the boot ROM sets a 
GPIB address of 29 when it's in firmware update mode.

Here's how that went:

* earlier, I had identified the `test_gpib()` function
* `test_gpib()` has a number of accesses to memory location 0x7000x:

    ![test_gpib() function](/assets/tds420a/test_gpib.png)

    These are almost certainly writes to the register space of some GPIB protocol 
    chip.

* When you double click on one of these registers, you get a list with all other
  functions that perform read or write accesses to them

    ![GPIB register references](/assets/tds420a/gpib_register_references.png)
    
* All you have to do now is go through all these unknown functions one by one until
  you find what you're looking for:

    ![gpib_init() function](/assets/tds420a/gpib_init.png)

    Bingo! 

    We've just identified the `gpib_init()` function!
