# Calibration

    * Switch on
    * Prepare -> Preheat PLA (220C for my filament. See filament spool)
    * Check that bed temperature is set to 50C.
    * Autohome printer: Perpare -> Auto Home
    * Disable stepper motors to level the bed: Prepare -> Disable steppers
    * Use piece of paper and move nozzle above the 4 leveling wheels. Adjust until there's a bit of resistance 
      when moving the paper.
    * Auto home to re-engage the stepper, then do disable stepper motors again, and do a final resistance check.

# Inserting filament

    * Increase Z axis by a few cm.
    * Insert filament until you feel some resistance. At that point, you should see some filament
      coming out.
