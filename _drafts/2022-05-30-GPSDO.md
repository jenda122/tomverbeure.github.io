    * The original amateur GPSDO project.
    * Uses a PIC for control and a DAC to regulate the OCXO.

* [Ein genaues und  stabiles 10 MHz Frequenznormal mit Ofen-Quarzoszillator (OCXO)](https://www.dl4zao.de/projekte/index.html#a1968)

    * PDF file... in German.
    * Very detailed description.
    * 74HC7046A phase comparator
    * Multiple output fanout board
    * Uses Neo board
    * Uses generic VC-OCXO: Bliley NV47, ENE 3311B, CTI OSC5A2B02

* [A high precision 10MHz GPS disciplined oscillator (GPSDO)](https://www.paulvdiyblogs.net/2020/07/a-high-precision-10mhz-gps-disciplined.html?m=1)

    * Excellent description, goes into a lot of detail to identify cause of inaccuracies.
    * Spends a lot of time and effort on temperature regulation.
    * Talks about different ublox modules.
    * Compares different OCXOs.

* [Probably the Simplest GPS Disciplined Oscillator possible](https://www.sdradio.eu/g4jnt/gpsdo.html)

    * Uses a Jupiter-T module with 10kHz output.
    * Some test results with [Argo - a DFCW and QRSS viewer](http://www.weaksignals.com/)

* [Simple GPS Stabilised 10 MHz Oscillator](http://jrmiller.online/projects/ministd/frqstd0.htm)

    * Uses a Jupiter-T module
    * Uses an Isotemp OCXO 124-10 

* [A SIMPLE GPS DISCIPLINED REFERENCE](https://www.qsl.net/zl1bpu/MICRO/SIMPLE/SimpleGPS.htm)

    * Uses an ATTINY to operate everything. 
    * RAKON OCXO (obsolete)
    * Trivial phase comparator with XOR port R/C filter
    * 74HC chip to dividede form 10MHz down to 10kHz

    * Need to read, but a lot of blog posts are pointing to this.

* [Tiny GPSDO](https://www.instructables.com/Tiny-GPSDO/)

    * On instructables.
    * "incomplete - need new PCB"
    * 10 outputs
    * Uses Neo 7 and Trimble OCXO
    * Uses 74HC4046 as phase comparator

* [Simple GPS Disciplined 10MHz Reference uses Dual PWMs](https://www.edn.com/simple-gps-disciplined-10mhz-reference-uses-dual-pwms/)

    * EDN website is horrible.
    * Arduino as controller.
    * Probably not very accurate due to non-use of fractional PWMs.
    * Uses VCXO, not an OCXO.

* [Remote GPSDO â€“ Hardware](https://f1atb.fr/index.php/2021/07/27/remote-gpsdo-hardware/)

    * Uses an Si5351A oscillator chip instead of an OXCO.
    * Generates a clock from 25kHz to 200MHz.
    * Clock generation is remote controlled.

* [An Arduino-based GPS Disciplined Oscillator](https://k6jca.blogspot.com/2016/02/an-arduino-based-gps-disciplined.html)

    * Uses an FLL, not a PLL.
    * Still has lots of info and some measurements.

* [A Simplified GPS-Derived Frequency Standard](http://ve2zaz.net/GPS_Std/Downloads/VE2ZAZ_GPS_Derived_Std_QEX_09_10_2006.pdf)

    * Uses a PIC controller.
    * FLL implementation.

* [GPSDO : GPS Disciplined Oscillator](https://www.vk4adc.com/web/index.php/general-projects/34-frequency-stabilisation/140-gpsdo-project)

    * A bit scrappy, but I should read it...
