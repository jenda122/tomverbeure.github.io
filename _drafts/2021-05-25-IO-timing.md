# Introduction

I've been working on getting USB up and running on my 
[Arrow DECA](/2021/04/23/Arrow-DECA-FPGA-board.html).

Like many other more advanced FPGA boards, the DECA doesn't have a generic USB
host or device controller[^1], and the MAX10 FPGA itself doesn't have the necessary special analog
IOs to support high-speed 480Mbps USB either.

[^1]: If you ignore the separate USB device controller that implements a USB Blaster-II.

USB 2.0 requires some specialized digital and analog cells to recover clocks, to support the
radically different signalling levels for full speed and high speed transmission, to support battery 
charging, or the now more or less obsolete On-The-Go.

Just like Ethernet defines an Ethernet MAC and an Ethernet PHY with
an [MII](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media-independent_interface) 
between them, the USB consortium created a well defined cut between a PHY that takes care of the low 
level protocol concerns, and the higher level functionality of device and host controllers. The lower level 
PHY is called the USB 2.0 Transceiver Macrocell (UTM), and the interface between a controller and a UTM is
defined by the [UTMI specification][UTMI-specification].

A UTM PHY can be located on the same die as a controller (changes are high that your cell phone
has a UTM cell on its main SOC), but there also separate chips that just contain a UTM. But
instead of using a ~35 IO pins that are required by the UTMI specification, they use the
[UTMI+ Low Pin Interface][ULPI-specification] (ULPI) which requires only 12 IO pins.

The overall system block diagram looks like this:

![System Diagram of USB with UTM interface](/assets/io_timings/io_timings-usb_system_with_ulpi.svg)

The FPGA core logic contains a host or device controller that talks to the external UTM PHY over
standard 3.3V digital IOs.

The interals of the UTM PHY aren't important for this blog post, but it contains a bunch of
digital logic that converts between a generic parallel data stream and the serialized USB traffic,
as well as PLLs, analog transceivers, voltage regulators, as shown in the block diagram of the
TUSB1210 UTM PHY that is used on the Arrow DECA:

![TUSB1210 Block Diagram](/assets/io_timings/tusb1210_block_diagram.png)

In this blog post, I won't talk about the high level functionality of USB controllers or PHYs, but about how
to ensure reliable communication over the digital ULPI interface.

# Failing ULPI Register Reads 

I'll be using a register read as an example, but everything discussed here applies to all ULPI transactions.

The following figure from the specification illustrates a ULPI register read transaction:

![ULPI Register Read Specification](/assets/io_timings/ulpi_register_read_specification.png)

There are 5 steps:

1. The link (the USB controller) issues a RegRead command on the data bus. It does this by setting the
   bits [7:6] of the data bus to 2'b11, and assigning the address to bits [5:0].
1. The PHY sees the RegRead command, and asserts `nxt` to inform the link.
1. The PHY asserts `dir` to turn around the direction of the data bus and take control of it.
1. The PHY drives the value of the requested register on the bus.
1. The PHY deasserts `dir` return control of the data bus to the link.

The specification is not explicit about whether or not the PHY can immediately assert `nxt` during step 1.
All it says, in section 3.8.3.1, is the following:

> For a register read, as shown in Figure 22, the Link sends a register read command and waits
> for **nxt** to assert.

However, one could reasonable expect a PHY to assert `nxt` *at the earliest* during the second cycle. If not, 
you'd end up with pretty impressive critical path: 

databus output FF of the link -> databus output IO path of the FPGA -> data bus input IO path of the PHY 
-> a combinatorial path inside the PHY -> `nxt` output IO path of PHY -> `nxt` input IO path of the link
-> FF inside the link.
 
That's just not going to happen at 60 MHz, especially not for a interface that was released 17 years
ago.

Here's a conceptual diagram that shows how the IO signals between the Link and PHY are almost
certainly wired up:

![Overall Setup Without Added Delays](/assets/io_timings/io_timings-overall_setup_no_delays.svg)

Things of note:

* The PHY creates the clock and sends it to the link. This is called ULPI *Output Clock* mode.
  Most PHYs also support *Input Clock* mode, where the link sends a clock to the PHY, but the
  Arrow DECA board on which I'm running this is configured in output clock mode.
* Output signals of a chip, whether it's the link or the PHY, are driven by a flip-flop
  right before going to the IO pin.
* Input signals, on the other hand, typically need to go through some combinatorial cloud
  of logic before they hit a register.
* The `ulpi_dir` signal coming from the PHY directly controls the output enable of the 
  `ulpi_data` IO pins: when `ulpi_dir` is high, the link stops driving `ulpi_data`.

I wrote a testbench that implements the ULPI PHY with the diagram above in mind, and ran a simulation.
The signal behavior matches the one of the ULPI specification:

![ULPI Register Read Simulation](/assets/io_timings/ulpi_register_read_simulation_correct.png)

However, once loaded into the FPGA, things didn't go that way:

![ULPI Register Read SignalTap Wrong](/assets/io_timings/ulpi_register_read_signaltap_wrong.png)

What we see here is that `ulpi_nxt` gets asserted during the first cycle during which 0xC1 is being  
driven by the link.

Looking a bit closer, you can see that I'm reading the register at address 0x01 (remember: the
lower 6 bits of 0xC1 indicate the address.) According to the ULPI specification, this register 
contains the MSB of the vendor ID of the PHY. The [TUSB1210][TUSB1210-product-page] PHY has a vendor 
ID of 0x0451. The PHY should return 0x04, but it's returning 0x51!

What is going on here?

The obvious first reaction is it that there's a problem with the chip. Everything is simulating fine,
how could I possibly be the problem! I was 
[not the only one with this reaction](https://community.intel.com/t5/Intel-Quartus-Prime-Software/Strange-code-behavior-once-it-works-once-not/m-p/253916/highlight/true?profile.language=ja):

But this is a chip that has been in production for years, and there are only 2 minor erratas. When
dealing with a bug in your C code, one should never first assume that the issue is with the compiler.
The same is through for issues like this.

When real world doesn't match simulation, chances are high that there's a signal integrity or
a timing issue.

# ULPI IO Timing

The first step is to check the IO timing requirements in the specification:

![ULPI Specification Timing Diagram](/assets/io_timings/ulpi_io_timing_specification.png)

*I edited the diagram to remove 4-bit mode, because most ULPI PHYs don't support that.*

The PHY is in "Output clock" mode. All the timings above are relative to the clock on the 
PHY IO pin.

The setup time is weird because it is indicates a max value. That doesn't make a lot of sense: 
setup time are supposed to be a minimum value. This turns out to be a bug in the 
specification. The TUSB1210 datasheet correctly lists it as a minimum value:

![TUSB1210 Timing Specification](/assets/io_timings/tusb1210_timing_specification.png)

Neither the specification nor the TUSB1210 datasheet list a minimum value for the output delay. 
But this is an important value on the receiving end, the link, because the minimum output delay 
determines the settings that check for hold violations. I will assume a value of 0 ns, because 
that's almost always a good conservative value.

*Another popular ULPI PHY, the [USB3300][USB3300-product-page], is more helpful in specifying a minimum
output delay:* 

![USB3300 Interface Timing](/assets/io_timings/usb3300_interface_timing.png)

*For this PHY, I would specify a 2ns hold time as input delay, instead of 0 ns.
Also notice how the maximum output delay is 5ns instead of 9ns, which makes
it much easier for the link to meet input timings.*

The TUSB1210 timing parameters translate into the following Quartus timing constraints:

```tcl
#**************************************************************
# Set Input Delay
#**************************************************************
set_input_delay -max -clock [get_clocks {ulpi_clk}] 9 [get_ports {ulpi_data[*]}]
set_input_delay -max -clock [get_clocks {ulpi_clk}] 9 [get_ports {ulpi_direction}]
set_input_delay -max -clock [get_clocks {ulpi_clk}] 9 [get_ports {ulpi_nxt}]

set_input_delay -min -clock [get_clocks {ulpi_clk}] 0 [get_ports {ulpi_data[*]}]
set_input_delay -min -clock [get_clocks {ulpi_clk}] 0 [get_ports {ulpi_direction}]
set_input_delay -min -clock [get_clocks {ulpi_clk}] 0 [get_ports {ulpi_nxt}]


#**************************************************************
# Set Output Delay
#**************************************************************
set_output_delay -clock [get_clocks {ulpi_clk}] 6 [get_ports {ulpi_data[*]}]
set_output_delay -clock [get_clocks {ulpi_clk}] 6 [get_ports {ulpi_stp}]
```

The PHY output delay of 9ns becomes an input delay of the the link. Similarly, the
6ns setup time of the PHY becomes an output delay of the link.

I add a `-max` to the 9ns input delay, and `-min` for the 0ns input delay.
**It is very important specify min and max values. Only listing the 9ns without `-max`
would make it impossible for the synthesis tool to prevent and for the static
timing analysis tool to check for hold time violations.**

# Static Timing Results with Specification Timing Parameters

After synthesizing the design, Quartus Timing Analyzer gives us the following results.

**Setup Time**

The worse case setup path under worst case conditions (85C, slow process) is an output path from a 
`ulpi_data_out` FF inside the link to an input pin of the PHY:

![Worst Case Setup Path Waveform](/assets/io_timings/output_delay_no_output_FF_no_PLL_waveform.png)

Quartus breaks up the timing path in the following sections:

* 3.508ns clock delay, from the `ulpi_clk` IO pin to the clock pin of the output FF.
* 4.863ns data delay, from the output of the FF to the `ulpi_data` IO pin

This gives a total delay of 8.371ns from `ulpi_clk` pin to the `ulpi_data` IO pin.

Meanwhile, the specification requires a 6.0ns input delay into the PHY. When
we subtract that from the 16.6ns clock period, we get 10.6ns.

This gives us a generic 2.209ns positive slack.

![Worst Case Setup Path Table](/assets/io_timings/output_delay_no_output_FF_no_PLL_table.png)

**Hold Time**

For the worst case hold time check, you need to run the analyzer on the fastest conditions: 0C, fast process.

When I run a hold time on my design without explicitly specifying IO paths, the IO paths don't even
show up in the list for the first 1000 nets. 

To get the hold violation for the `ulpi_nxt` path, I need to run the following command:

```tcl
report_timing -from ulpi_nxt -hold -npaths 1000 -detail full_path -panel_name {Report Timing} -multi_corner
```

![ULPI_NXT Hold Time Waveform](/assets/io_timings/hold_time_no_output_FF_no_PLL_fail_waveform.png)

* hold time requirement is set to 0ns.
* data delay from the `ulpi_nxt` IO pin to the data input of the first FF is 2.572ns.
* clock delay from the `ulpi_clk` IO pin to clock input of that same FF is 1.965ns.

Add 0.071ns of clock uncertainty, and you end up with a positive hold time slack of 0.536ns.

![ULPI_NXT Hold Time Table](/assets/io_timings/hold_time_no_output_FF_no_PLL_fail_table.png)

*The hold time check for `ulpi_dir` has similar results.*

0.536ns is a respectable margin, and the numbers on my board should be quite a bit higher
because the temperature in my garage is definitely not 0 Celsius! Under worst case conditions
of 85 C and a slow process, the hold time positive slack is 1.4ns. 

So there is no obvious timing violation, and yet the thing doesn't work. 

What can we do next?

# First Principle Analysis of the Failing Waveform

Let's go back to the beginning and look at the expected waveform, and the waveform recorded by
the SignalTap logic analyzer:

Exptected:

![ULPI Register Read Simulation](/assets/io_timings/ulpi_register_read_simulation_correct.png)

Recorded:

![ULPI Register Read SignalTap Wrong](/assets/io_timings/ulpi_register_read_signaltap_wrong.png)

Once again, we see that in the failing case, `ulpi_nxt` gets asserted during the first cycle,
the cycle in which 0xC1 shows up on the bus. This can simply not happen when `ulpi_nxt` is
driven directly by a flip-flop and under theoretical conditional where the clock edge rises
at exactly the same time everywhere in the synchronous design.

But what happens if that is not the case?

That's what happens below. (Click on the image to get the enlarged version!)

[![ULPI NXT hold time violation](/assets/io_timings/hold_violation.png)](/assets/io_timings/hold_violation.svg){:target="_blank"}

First, we see the delay between the clock at the IO pin of the PHY and the core of the link.

Then we see the progression of events starting with the link sending out a register read
address on `ulpi_data`, the reaction of the PHY by asserting `ulpi_nxt`, how that assertion
is perceived by the link, and ultimately, captured by SignalTap.

If the delay between the clock inside the link in the Phy is large enough, and if the
delay between the FF that creates `ulpi_nxt` in the phy and the arrival of that signal at a FF
inside the link is short enough, you get a classic case shoot-through, where a signal
that meant to arrive at the next cycle, arrives a cycle earlier.

The pattern of the timing diagram above exactly matches the pattern that was captured on the
real SignalTap.

# Fix 1: More Stringent Hold Time Settings

If the theory about an ordinary hold time violation on `ulpi_nxt` is correct, then a potential
fix would be increase the minimum input delay requirements on that signal. Let's change
it from 0ns to -1.0ns:

```tcl
set_input_delay -min -clock [get_clocks {ulpi_clk}] -1.0 [get_ports {ulpi_data[*]}]
set_input_delay -min -clock [get_clocks {ulpi_clk}] -1.0 [get_ports {ulpi_direction}]
set_input_delay -min -clock [get_clocks {ulpi_clk}] -1.0 [get_ports {ulpi_nxt}]
```
Here's the result on SignalTap:

![Register Read Pass](/assets/io_timings/signaltap_pass.png)

It's working now! 

Here's hold time waveform:

![Hold Time with lower input delay](/assets/io_timings/hold_time_with_lower_input_delay_pass_waveform.png)

Compare this figure to the failing case above and... we have a mystery on our hands:
j
* The input delay has been changed from 0ns to -1.0ns, as requested.
* The data delay has increase from 2.572ns to 3.749ns.

    An increase by little more than 1 ns.

* The clock delay is rouglhy the same, with an increase from 1.965ns to 2.096ns.

The end result is that the positive slack is 0.582ns, only 50ps more than the failing case.

When I increase the input delay from -1.0ns to -1.5ns, the data delay increases again by the same amount:
from 3.749ns to 4.240ns. And the resulting positive slack is 0.573ns. For whatever reason, Quartus
force the hold time slack to be ~0.575ns.

Note, however, that this is for the fastest transistor conditions, 0C and fast silicon. Under 
slowest conditions, and with an input delay of -1.5ns, the hold time slack increases from
the earlier 1.4ns to 3.1ns.

The slack on my board, room temperature and probably some silicon that has average speed, must
be somewhere between 0.5ns and 3.1ns.

I find this a very unsatisfying situation: yes, I identified the failing case as a hold time
violation, and, yes, my board is working now. But I don't have timing reports that prove that
a failing condition has been corrected. And because of that, I also can't be sure that my
design works under all silicon conditions.

Unfortunately, there is no easy way on the DECA board to probe the `ulpi_clk` and `ulpi_nxt` signals
close to the FPGA.

# Fix 2: Use a PLL to Align the Phy Clock and the Link Clock

Hold time violations are caused by delays between the launch clock and the capture clock of 
a signal. When these 2 clock edges coincide, a hold violation isn't possible.

In the earlier fix, changing the minimum input delay touched the data delay path, but it didn't fix
the issue of clocks that were skewed by ~2ns due to delay in the clock IO path and the global clock
buffer of the FPGA.

A different fix does just that: it uses a PLL with 1:1 ratio that tries to perfectly align the 
clock at the input of the PLL with the clock at the output of the global clock buffer.
