# Introduction

I've been working on getting my own SpinalHDL USB core up and running on an 
[Arrow DECA](/2021/04/23/Arrow-DECA-FPGA-board.html) FPGA board. It's one of 
those half-complete project that might not ever be finished, so this blog post isn't 
specifically about that. However, I ran into an issue that forced me to learn
some of the finer details of specifying IO timings that I want to share here.

Like many other more advanced FPGA boards, the DECA doesn't have a generic USB
host or device controller[^1], and the MAX10 FPGA itself doesn't have the
IOs to support high-speed 480Mbps USB either:
USB 2.0 requires some specialized digital and analog cells to recover clocks, to support the
signalling levels that are radically different between full speed and high speed, to support battery 
charging, or to support USB On-The-Go.

[^1]: If you ignore the separate USB device controller that implements a USB Blaster-II.

Just like Ethernet defines a [MAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medium_access_control), 
a [PHY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHY), 
and a [media-independent Interface (MII)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media-independent_interface) 
between them, the USB consortium created a well-defined cut between a PHY that takes care of the low 
level protocol concerns, and the higher level functionality of device and host controllers. The lower level 
PHY is called the USB 2.0 Transceiver Macrocell (UTM), and the interface between a controller and a UTM is
defined by the [UTMI specification][UTMI-specification].

A UTM PHY can be located on the same die as a controller (chances are *very* high that your cell phone
has one or more UTM cells on its main SOC), but there are also separate chips that just contain a UTM. 
However, instead of using the ~35 IO pins that are required by the UTMI specification, they use the
[UTMI+ Low Pin Interface (ULPI)][ULPI-specification] which requires only 12 IO pins.

The overall system block diagram of such a configuration, which matches the one of the Arrow DECA
board, looks like this:

![System Diagram of USB with UTM interface](/assets/io_timings/io_timings-usb_system_with_ulpi.svg)

The FPGA core logic contains a host or device controller that talks to the external UTM PHY over
standard digital IOs.

A UTM PHY contains a bunch of digital logic that converts between a generic parallel data stream 
and the serialized USB traffic, as well as PLLs, analog transceivers, voltage regulators, as shown 
in the block diagram of the [TUSB1210 UTM PHY][TUSB1210-product-page] that is used on the Arrow DECA:

![TUSB1210 Block Diagram](/assets/io_timings/tusb1210_block_diagram.png)

The 12 pins of the ULPI interface are at the bottom left of this diagram.

In this blog post, I won't talk about the high level functionality of USB controllers or PHYs, but about how
to ensure reliable communication over the digital ULPI interface.

# A Typical ULPI Transaction

*I'll be using a register read as an example, but everything discussed here applies to all ULPI transactions.*

The following figure from the specification illustrates a ULPI register read transaction:

![ULPI Register Read Specification](/assets/io_timings/ulpi_register_read_specification.png)

There are 5 steps:

1. The link (the USB host or device controller) issues a RegRead command on the data bus. It does this by setting
   bits [7:6] of the data bus to 2'b11, and assigning the address to bits [5:0].
1. The PHY sees the RegRead command, and asserts `nxt` to inform the link.
1. The PHY asserts `dir` to turn around the direction of the data bus and take control of it. However,
   it doesn't drive the data bus yet. This is called a *bus turn around* cycle.
1. The PHY drives the value of the requested register on the bus.
1. The PHY deasserts `dir` return control of the data bus to the link, and stops driving
   the data bus. Another bus turn around cycle.

The specification is not explicit about whether or not the PHY can immediately assert `nxt` during step 1.
All it says, in section 3.8.3.1, is the following:

> For a register read, as shown in Figure 22, the Link sends a register read command and waits
> for **nxt** to assert.

However, one could reasonable expect a PHY to assert `nxt` *at the earliest* during the second cycle. If not, 
you'd end up with pretty impressive critical path: 

databus output FF of the link -> databus output IO path of the FPGA -> data bus input IO path of the PHY 
-> a combinatorial path inside the PHY -> `nxt` output IO path of PHY -> `nxt` input IO path of the link
-> FF inside the link.
 
That's just not going to happen at 60 MHz, especially not for an interface that was released 17 years
ago.

Here's a conceptual diagram that shows how the IO signals between the Link and PHY are almost
certainly wired up:

![Overall Setup Without Added Delays](/assets/io_timings/io_timings-overall_setup_no_delays.svg)

Things of note:

* The PHY creates the clock and sends it to the link. This is called ULPI *Output Clock* mode.
  Most PHYs also support the optional *Input Clock* mode, where the link sends a clock to the PHY, 
  but the Arrow DECA board is configured in output clock mode.
* Output signals of a chip, whether it's the link or the PHY, are driven by a flip-flop
  right before going to the IO pin.
* Input signals, on the other hand, typically need to go through some combinatorial cloud
  of logic before they hit a register.
* The `ulpi_dir` signal coming from the PHY directly controls the output enable of the 
  `ulpi_data` IO pins: when `ulpi_dir` is high, the link stops driving `ulpi_data` through
  a combinatorial path.

Most USB controllers have a UTMI interface, so you need a UTMI to ULPI protocol conversion
block that sits between the controller and the IO pins. 
That's my [Utmi2Ulpi](https://github.com/tomverbeure/usb_system/blob/main/spinal/src/main/scala/usb/Utmi2Ulpi.scala)
block.

To test it, I wrote a testbench that implements a behavioral model of a ULPI PHY with the diagram 
above in mind, and ran a simulation. The signal behavior matches the one of the ULPI specification:

![ULPI Register Read Simulation](/assets/io_timings/ulpi_register_read_simulation_correct.png)

So far so good!

# ULPI Reads Failing in the Real World

Once I had a working simulation, I tried ULPI register reads on the actual hardware. That's
where things went off the rails: the expected values were either plain wrong, or the the interface
was hanging.

I used SignalTap to observe what was going on inside the FPGA:

![ULPI Register Read SignalTap Wrong](/assets/io_timings/ulpi_register_read_signaltap_wrong.png)

In the transaction above, you see value 0xC1 being driven onto `ulpi_data`. Remember: the
upper 2 bits of 0xC1, 2'b11, indicate a register read, and the lower 6 bits, 0x01, indicate the address. 
According to the ULPI specification, register 0x01 contains the MSB of the vendor ID of the PHY. 
The TUSB1210 PHY has a vendor ID of 0x0451. The PHY should return 0x04, but it's returning 0x51!

You can also see how `ulpi_nxt` gets asserted during the first cycle during which 0xC1 is being  
driven by the link.

What is going on here?

The *obvious* first reaction is it that there's a problem with the chip. Everything is simulating fine,
how could I possibly be the problem! I was 
[not the only one with this reaction](https://community.intel.com/t5/Intel-Quartus-Prime-Software/Strange-code-behavior-once-it-works-once-not/m-p/253916/highlight/true?profile.language=ja):

> Maybe I have a clue - I could not communicate with tusb1210 as it is written in ULPI standard. To write to tusb1210 register, 
> I had to make some hacks (i.e. register usb_stupid_test in `top/ULPI.v`), what is ridiculous, but after this hack it finally 
> started to work (for few days...).

But this is a chip that has been in production for years, and there are only 
[2 minor erratas](https://www.ti.com/lit/er/sllz066/sllz066.pdf?ts=1630776676403). 
When with misbehaving C code, assuming a bug in the compiler should be your very last option.  The same is through 
for issues like this.

**When the real world doesn't match your simulation, chances are high that there's a signal integrity or
a timing issue.**

# A Timing Constraints Refresher

In Quartus, Vivado, and most other modern FPGA or ASIC synthesis and timing analysis tools
(not Xilinx ISE!), timing constraints are specified with an `.sdc` file, short for
Synospys Design Constraint file. An SDC file is really just TCL file (the world's most
wretched programming language) with custom timing specification commands. You can
use `if`, `eval` and other standard TCL constructs, which is useful if you have different
configurations, such as slightly different constraints for different FPGA chips or
boards.


Timing constraints are used to specify and check 2 key timing aspects of a design:


* setup time

    The setup time is the minimum time during which a signal must be stable **before**
    it can reliably be captured by the active edge of a clock (the 'latching edge').

* hold time

    The hold time is the minium time during which a signal must be stable
    **after** the active edge of a clock to reliably capture a signal.

![setup and hold time diagram](/assets/io_timings/io_timings-setup_hold.svg)

In the diagram above, the rising edge of the clock is the active edge, but a falling
edge is possible too.

The sum of the setup and hold time is the window during which a signal must remain constant
to reliably capture and store data into a flip-flop.

**Setup Time**

When a timing analysis tool checks the setup time, it does the following for each path 
between 2 flip-flops:

1. Check if the path between 2 flip-flops can be ignored.

    The timing constraints will often mark paths as false paths. 
    
    A good example of this are paths between flip-flops that belong to asynchronous
    clock domains.

1. Find the launch clocks: the clocks that are connected to the launching flip-flop.
1. Find the latching clocks: the clocks that are connected to the latching flip-flop.

    It's possible for both the launching and latching flip-flop to have multiple clocks. 
    This can happen when there is a multiplexer in the clock path.

1. Find the shortest possible positive delay between any possible launch edge and any possible
   latching edge. This will be the initial setup time to check.

    For the majority for cases, the latch and launch edges will be on the same clock,
    and the shortest possible positive delay will be the same as the clock period:

    ![setup edges trivial](/assets/io_timings/io_timings-setup_edges_trivial.svg)

    But in the example below, the launch clock and latch clock have a different frequency. The
    timing analyzer will go through all launch and latch edge combinations and find the smallest
    value. In this case, that smallest value is 1ns:

    ![setup edges](/assets/io_timings/io_timings-setup_edges.svg)

    When looking for this initial setup time, the timing analyzer will looks at clock edges
    at their source, **without taking into account the delay from the source of the
    clock to the clock input of the flip-flop.**

1. Apply an optional multi-cycle adjustment to the setup time.

    A common case for applying a multi-cycle adjustment is when the launch and latch clock
    have the same frequency, but there is a phase shift between them. 

    In the diagram below, a latch clock was created that is shifted 60[^3] degrees ahead 
    of the launch clock. If the intent of logic is that the data is latched 7ns 
    instead of 1ns after being generated on the launch clock, a 1-cycle multi-cycle adjustment 
    must be applied:

    [^3]: 1ns / 6ns * 360 = 60

    ![setup multi-cycle path](/assets/io_timings/io_timings-setup_multi_cycle_path.svg)

    One reason to have such a phase shifted clock is to make meeting setup timing easier
    In the example above, the delay from the launching to the latching FF can be 1ns higher before
    violating the setup time. This technique is commonly used when dealing with 
    external IO interfaces. (Doing this is not free: shifted a latch clock forward increases 
    the hold time by the same amount!)

1. Calculate the launch to latch delay: the total delay from the starting point of the launch clock,
   through the launch FFs, to the data input of the latching flip-flop

    ![setup launch to latch delay](/assets/io_timings/io_timings-setup_launch_to_latch_delay.svg)

1. Calculate the latch delay: delay from the starting point of the latch clock to the latching
   flip-flop

    ![setup latch delay](/assets/io_timings/io_timings-setup_latch_delay.svg)

1. Check whether or not the difference between these 2 delays is smaller or larger
   than the required setup time of the latching FF.

    ![check setup time](/assets/io_timings/io_timings-check_setup_time.svg)

    In the diagram above, with the launch clock shifted by 60 degress, you can see how the arrival 
    time of the signal from the launch signal plus the required setup time is smaller than the 
    time at which that signal gets captured in the received FF. For this path, setup timing is met.

**Hold Time**

When a timing analysis tool checks the setup time, it does the following for each path 
between 2 flip-flops:

1. Check if the path between 2 flip-flops can be ignored.
1. Find the launch clocks: the clocks that are connected to the launching flip-flop.
1. Find the latching clocks: the clocks that are connected to the latching flip-flop.

    These steps are the same as for setup time.

1. 



**Timing Constraint Commands**


The most important timing constraint commands are:

* `create_clock -name <clock name> -period <clock period> [clock design element]`

    This defines a clock and specifies where on a timeline there'll be endlessly repeating
    rising and falling edges. You specify a clock design element (such as a 
    FPGA IO port or the pin of a PLL), which case clock calculation will ripple
    through all the connected elements of said clock (e.g. the delay through a
    clock buffer will be taking into account). Or you don't, and then you create
    a so-called virtual clock.

* `create_generated_clock ...`

    This create an internal clock that is created internally in the design as a
    derivative from another so-called master clock. A good example is a clock that is created by 
    a PLL, where the input of the PLL is the master clock.

    There are [a lot of options](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/quartushelp/13.0/mergedProjects/tafs/tafs/tcl_pkg_sdc_ver_1.5_cmd_create_generated_clock.htm) 
    that allow you to set ratios, phase shifts, duty cycle, etc.


* `set_input_delay -clock <clock name> <delay> <design elements> [-max|-min]`

    This create an imaginary, ideal flip-flop with zero clock-to-output delay, 
    connected to the given clock, and a delay element, the output of which is connected to the design elements.

    ![set_input_delay conceptual diagram](/assets/io_timings/io_timings-set_input_delay.svg)

    By using the `-min` and the `-max` options, you can specify a range of delays.

* `set_output_delay -clock <clock name> <delay> <design elements> [-max|-min]`

    The opposite of `set_input_delay`, this connects the given design elements to an
    imaginary delay element which feeds into the data input of an ideal flip-flip that
    is again connected to the given clock.

    ![set_output_delay conceptual diagram](/assets/io_timings/io_timings-set_output_delay.svg)

* `set_max_delay [-from <design elements>] [-to <design elemenets>] <value>`

    `set_input_delay` and `set_output_delay` are higher level timing constraints, in that
    they add 'fake' delay and FFs elements to the overall design and treat them like other
    FFs, gates and delays. When you change the clock speed, the timing calculations to
    these fake FFs will change accordingly.

    `set_max_delay` is different: it sets a setup constraints at a specific point in time.
    When you change the clock for a register that drives a design element to which a max delay
    is assigned, this max delay will not change, and thus the setup time won't change either.

    It's best to not use `set_max_delay` if you can avoid it, but it's good to have it for

# ULPI IO Timing

Before we start to debug things, let's first rewind a little bit and have a look at the 
the IO timing requirements in the specification. At first sight, they are relatively
straightforward:

![ULPI Specification Timing Diagram](/assets/io_timings/ulpi_io_timing_specification.png)

*(I edited the diagram to remove 4-bit DDR mode, because most ULPI PHYs don't support that.)*

The PHY is in "Output clock" mode. All the timings above are using the PHY clock IO
as reference point.

**ULPI Clock Definition**

The ULPI clock has a frequency of 60MHz. It's always good practise to define a virtual
clock for the logic that lives outside of the chip/FPGA. Let's define that clock 
as follows:

```tcl
create_clock -name ulpi_clk_phy -period 16.6
```

*Note how the clock that I defined above isn't linked to any FPGA pin. That's what
makes it a virtual clock.*

The PHY clock is connected to `ulpi_clk` pin of the Link, our
FPGA. According to Google, the speed of light in a PCB is around 16.3cm/ns. 
The distance from the ULPI PHY to the FPGA is around 2cm, which gives a delay of
around 0.12ns. That's too low to worry about, but let's just roll with it, and
define the FPGA ULPI clock like this:

```tcl
create_clock -name ulpi_clk -period 16.6 [get_ports ulpi_clk]
set_clock_latency -source 0.12 [get_clocks {ulpi_clk}]
```

**Setup time: 6.0ns**

In general, a setup time specifies how long a signal must be stable before it can
reliably be captured by a flip-flop. 

The weird thing about the ULPI specification is that it shows a maximum value. That 
doesn't make a lot of sense: setup times are supposed to be a minimum value. This 
turns out to be a bug in the specification.[^2] 
The TUSB1210 datasheet correctly lists it as a minimum value:

[^2]: So much for always assuming that the chip, compiler, or specification is correct!

![TUSB1210 Timing Specification](/assets/io_timings/tusb1210_timing_specification.png)

Note that the setup time is listed "control in, 8-bit data in", from the point of
view of the PHY. We need to construct timing constraints for the other side, the link,
so the setup time for the PHY becomes a maximum output delay for the link:

```tcl
set_output_delay -clock [get_clocks {ulpi_clk_phy}] 6 [get_ports {ulpi_data[*]}] -max
set_output_delay -clock [get_clocks {ulpi_clk_phy}] 6 [get_ports {ulpi_stp}] -max
```

The 0ns hold time for ULPI PHY input pins becomes a 0ns minimum output delay for the link:

```tcl
set_output_delay -clock [get_clocks {ulpi_clk_phy}] 0 [get_ports {ulpi_data[*]}] -min
set_output_delay -clock [get_clocks {ulpi_clk_phy}] 0 [get_ports {ulpi_stp}] -min
```


Neither the specification nor the TUSB1210 datasheet list a minimum value for the output delay. 
But this is an important value on the receiving end, the link, because the minimum output delay 
determines the settings that check for hold violations. I will assume a value of 0 ns, because 
that's almost always a good conservative value.

*Another popular ULPI PHY, the [USB3300][USB3300-product-page], is more helpful in specifying a minimum
output delay:* 

![USB3300 Interface Timing](/assets/io_timings/usb3300_interface_timing.png)

*For this PHY, I would specify a 2ns hold time as input delay, instead of 0 ns.
Also notice how the maximum output delay is 5ns instead of 9ns, which makes
it much easier for the link to meet input timings.*

The TUSB1210 timing parameters translate into the following Quartus timing constraints:

```tcl
#**************************************************************
# Set Input Delay
#**************************************************************
set_input_delay -max -clock [get_clocks {ulpi_clk}] 9 [get_ports {ulpi_data[*]}]
set_input_delay -max -clock [get_clocks {ulpi_clk}] 9 [get_ports {ulpi_direction}]
set_input_delay -max -clock [get_clocks {ulpi_clk}] 9 [get_ports {ulpi_nxt}]

set_input_delay -min -clock [get_clocks {ulpi_clk}] 0 [get_ports {ulpi_data[*]}]
set_input_delay -min -clock [get_clocks {ulpi_clk}] 0 [get_ports {ulpi_direction}]
set_input_delay -min -clock [get_clocks {ulpi_clk}] 0 [get_ports {ulpi_nxt}]


#**************************************************************
# Set Output Delay
#**************************************************************
set_output_delay -clock [get_clocks {ulpi_clk}] 6 [get_ports {ulpi_data[*]}]
set_output_delay -clock [get_clocks {ulpi_clk}] 6 [get_ports {ulpi_stp}]
```

The PHY output delay of 9ns becomes an input delay of the the link. Similarly, the
6ns setup time of the PHY becomes an output delay of the link.

I add a `-max` to the 9ns input delay, and `-min` for the 0ns input delay.
**It is very important specify min and max values. Only listing the 9ns without `-max`
would make it impossible for the synthesis tool to prevent hold time violations, and 
for the static timing analysis tool to check for them.**

# Static Timing Results with Specification Timing Parameters

After synthesizing the design, Quartus Timing Analyzer gives us the following results.

**Setup Time**

The worse case setup path under worst case conditions (85C, slow process) is an output path from a 
`ulpi_data_out` FF inside the link to an input pin of the PHY:

![Worst Case Setup Path Waveform](/assets/io_timings/output_delay_no_output_FF_no_PLL_waveform.png)

Quartus breaks up the timing path in the following sections:

* 3.508ns clock delay, from the `ulpi_clk` IO pin to the clock pin of the output FF.
* 4.863ns data delay, from the output of the FF to the `ulpi_data` IO pin

This gives a total delay of 8.371ns from `ulpi_clk` pin to the `ulpi_data` IO pin.

Meanwhile, the specification requires a 6.0ns input delay into the PHY. When
we subtract that from the 16.6ns clock period, we get 10.6ns.

This gives us a generic 2.209ns positive slack.

![Worst Case Setup Path Table](/assets/io_timings/output_delay_no_output_FF_no_PLL_table.png)

**Hold Time**

For the worst case hold time check, you need to run the analyzer on the fastest conditions: 0C, fast process.

When I run a hold time on my design without explicitly specifying IO paths, the IO paths don't even
show up in the list for the first 1000 nets. 

To get the hold violation for the `ulpi_nxt` path, I need to run the following command:

```tcl
report_timing -from ulpi_nxt -hold -npaths 1000 -detail full_path -panel_name {Report Timing} -multi_corner
```

![ULPI_NXT Hold Time Waveform](/assets/io_timings/hold_time_no_output_FF_no_PLL_fail_waveform.png)

* hold time requirement is set to 0ns.
* data delay from the `ulpi_nxt` IO pin to the data input of the first FF is 2.572ns.
* clock delay from the `ulpi_clk` IO pin to clock input of that same FF is 1.965ns.

Add 0.071ns of clock uncertainty, and you end up with a positive hold time slack of 0.536ns.

![ULPI_NXT Hold Time Table](/assets/io_timings/hold_time_no_output_FF_no_PLL_fail_table.png)

*The hold time check for `ulpi_dir` has similar results.*

0.536ns is a respectable margin, and the numbers on my board should be quite a bit higher
because the temperature in my garage is definitely not 0 Celsius! Under worst case conditions
of 85 C and a slow process, the hold time positive slack is 1.4ns. 

So there is no obvious timing violation, and yet the thing doesn't work. 

What can we do next?

# First Principle Analysis of the Failing Waveform

Let's go back to the beginning and look at the expected waveform, and the waveform recorded by
the SignalTap logic analyzer:

Exptected:

![ULPI Register Read Simulation](/assets/io_timings/ulpi_register_read_simulation_correct.png)

Recorded:

![ULPI Register Read SignalTap Wrong](/assets/io_timings/ulpi_register_read_signaltap_wrong.png)

Once again, we see that in the failing case, `ulpi_nxt` gets asserted during the first cycle,
the cycle in which 0xC1 shows up on the bus. This can simply not happen when `ulpi_nxt` is
driven directly by a flip-flop and under theoretical conditional where the clock edge rises
at exactly the same time everywhere in the synchronous design.

But what happens if that is not the case?

That's what happens below. (Click on the image to get the enlarged version!)

[![ULPI NXT hold time violation](/assets/io_timings/hold_violation.png)](/assets/io_timings/hold_violation.svg){:target="_blank"}

First, we see the delay between the clock at the IO pin of the PHY and the core of the link.

Then we see the progression of events starting with the link sending out a register read
address on `ulpi_data`, the reaction of the PHY by asserting `ulpi_nxt`, how that assertion
is perceived by the link, and ultimately, captured by SignalTap.

If the delay between the clock inside the link in the Phy is large enough, and if the
delay between the FF that creates `ulpi_nxt` in the phy and the arrival of that signal at a FF
inside the link is short enough, you get a classic case shoot-through, where a signal
that meant to arrive at the next cycle, arrives a cycle earlier.

The pattern of the timing diagram above exactly matches the pattern that was captured on the
real SignalTap.

# Fix 1: More Stringent Hold Time Settings

If the theory about an ordinary hold time violation on `ulpi_nxt` is correct, then a potential
fix would be increase the minimum input delay requirements on that signal. Let's change
it from 0ns to -1.0ns:

```tcl
set_input_delay -min -clock [get_clocks {ulpi_clk}] -1.0 [get_ports {ulpi_data[*]}]
set_input_delay -min -clock [get_clocks {ulpi_clk}] -1.0 [get_ports {ulpi_direction}]
set_input_delay -min -clock [get_clocks {ulpi_clk}] -1.0 [get_ports {ulpi_nxt}]
```
Here's the result on SignalTap:

![Register Read Pass](/assets/io_timings/signaltap_pass.png)

It's working now! 

Here's hold time waveform:

![Hold Time with lower input delay](/assets/io_timings/hold_time_with_lower_input_delay_pass_waveform.png)

Compare this figure to the failing case above and... we have a mystery on our hands:
j
* The input delay has been changed from 0ns to -1.0ns, as requested.
* The data delay has increase from 2.572ns to 3.749ns.

    An increase by little more than 1 ns.

* The clock delay is rouglhy the same, with an increase from 1.965ns to 2.096ns.

The end result is that the positive slack is 0.582ns, only 50ps more than the failing case.

When I increase the input delay from -1.0ns to -1.5ns, the data delay increases again by the same amount:
from 3.749ns to 4.240ns. And the resulting positive slack is 0.573ns. For whatever reason, Quartus
force the hold time slack to be ~0.575ns.

Note, however, that this is for the fastest transistor conditions, 0C and fast silicon. Under 
slowest conditions, and with an input delay of -1.5ns, the hold time slack increases from
the earlier 1.4ns to 3.1ns.

The slack on my board, room temperature and probably some silicon that has average speed, must
be somewhere between 0.5ns and 3.1ns.

I find this a very unsatisfying situation: yes, I identified the failing case as a hold time
violation, and, yes, my board is working now. But I don't have timing reports that prove that
a failing condition has been corrected. And because of that, I also can't be sure that my
design works under all silicon conditions.

Unfortunately, there is no easy way on the DECA board to probe the `ulpi_clk` and `ulpi_nxt` signals
close to the FPGA.

# Fix 2: Use a PLL to Align the Phy Clock and the Link Clock

Hold time violations are caused by delays between the launch clock and the capture clock of 
a signal. When these 2 clock edges coincide, a hold violation isn't possible.

In the earlier fix, changing the minimum input delay touched the data delay path, but it didn't fix
the issue of clocks that were skewed by ~2ns due to delay in the clock IO path and the global clock
buffer of the FPGA.

A different fix does just that: it uses a PLL with 1:1 ratio that tries to perfectly align the 
clock at the input of the PLL with the clock at the output of the global clock buffer.
