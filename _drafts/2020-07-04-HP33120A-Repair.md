# Introduction

# Debug

* Broken unit: C717 blown up.

    This is a regular decoupling cap between -15V and AGND.

* Zener CR704 (3.3V) is broken

    Used to convert -18V to -15V

* +AMP_IN (schematic page 7, page 137), R758

    working unit: no DC offset, broken unit: DC offset of ~1.25V

* +FL_OUT

    working unit: no DC offset, broken unit: DC offset of ~1.25V

* +/- DAC_OUT

    working unit: no DC offset, broken unit: DC offset of ~1.25V

* Output of U407: SPT5300SCP DAC

    working unit: no DC offset, broken unit: DC offset of ~1.25V

* Digital input of U407: identical. (Page 133 of service manual)

    * Pin 28: MSB: square wave
    * Pin 26: Latch: 40MHz clock

    * Chip is marked as SPT5300SCP. There's an audio DAC with exactly the same
      name, but it has a different pinout and functionality. However, the 
      service manual says "IC DA HS ECL 28PLCC 40MS 12B" - "TDC1112R3C3"

        * There's a TDC1112 by TRW (1990). See private datasheet stash.
        * TRW acquired by Raytheon in 1992.
        * [Raytheon datasheet](https://datasheetspdf.com/pdf/545046/Raytheon/TDC1112/1)
        * Schematic shows AD9713JP. [Analog Devices datasheet](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/obsolete-data-sheets/254851525AD9713.pdf)
