# Introduction

I recently become the proud owner of an HP 16500A logic analyzer for the 
low low price of $20. It's a mainframe design, with a 6 slot backplane that contains
a CPU system that's based on a Motorola 68000, and 5 additional slots for various
plug-in measurement units. In my case, it came with an 80 channel 25MHz/100MHz 
digital acquisition card with a 4K acquisition depth, but higher performance cards 
exist. The display is a a 9" color CRT.

The logic analyzer functionality itself is not particularly useful for me: 
I never need that many channels, it's a huge beast the impractical to move around,
the acquisition depth is pathetic, the maximum sample rate is too low, 
and it's not trivial to get data of the machine for later analysis (you need either 
a non-standard floppy or you need a GPIB interface).

But it's fun to take a vintage piece of electronics is always fun just for the sake
of it, and after doing that, I found out that the CRT is a Sony CHM-9001-00 with
a Trinitron tube, a self-contained unit that can relatively easily be removed
from the main chassis.

It made me wonder if there'd be some to use it in some creative ways?

In this blog post, I dive into some of the details of this CRT and try to
figure out how it interacts with the rest of the system.

# Opening up the Logic Analyzer

# Safety

* No bleeder resistors
* Watch out for screws falling into the electronics
* plastic covers around the CRT
* clean desk or cart

# A First Look at the CRT 

* Information from the HP service manual
    * Section 4-5: Color Display Module Adjustment
 	Includes white balance with RV901 and RV902.
    * Page 6-3 System Overview Theory
        120V supply is only used by the color module.
   	CPU board block diagram
    * Page 6-34: Video Signals Check
	Contains connector pinout.
* How the CRT is driven by the logic analyzer
    * CPU board Block diagram 
    * Chips on the CPU board
    * Voltage levels
    * Connector
* CRT PCBs
* CRT resolution: 576x368
    * Aspect ratio: roughly 14:9
    * old school games (donkey kong, pacman etc): 256x224, 8:7 aspect ratio
