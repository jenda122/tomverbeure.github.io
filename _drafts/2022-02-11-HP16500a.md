# Introduction

I recently became the proud owner of an HP 16500A logic analyzer for the low low price of $20.

![Logic Analyzer on Cart](/assets/hp16500a/blog/1_logic_analyzer_on_cart.jpg)

It's a mainframe design, with a 6 slot backplane that contains a CPU system, based on 
a Motorola 68000, and 5 additional slots for various plug-in measurement units. My unit 
came with an HP 16510A: an 80 channel 25MHz/100MHz digital acquisition card with a 4K 
acquisition depth, but higher performance cards exist. 

The logic analyzer functionality itself is not particularly useful for me: 
I never need that many channels, it's a huge beast that's impractical to move around,
the acquisition depth is pathetic, the maximum sample rate is too low, 
and it's not trivial to get data of the machine for later analysis, since you'd
need either a non-standard floppy drive or a GPIB interface. In short, this unit
is worse in almost any respect than the [Saleae Logic Pro 16](https://www.saleae.com) 
that I use at work.

But it's always fun to take a vintage piece of electronics apart for the sake
of it, learn about its special features, and maybe come up with some interesting
future project ideas?

So in this blog post, I'll take who thing apart and try to figure out how what makes
it tick.

# Safety

Before opening and working on this machine, it's import talk about safety: 

**WORKING ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD KILL YOU.** 

There, I’ve said it. So, please, if you're not familiar with devices like this,
just read this blog for entertainment and don't try to reproduce my results.
If you decide to do it anyway, you do so at your risk, and take a number of 
basic precautions:

* **Read the [HP 16500A][HP 16500A Service Manual] and the [Sony CHM-9001-00][CHM-9001 Service Manual] 
  service manuals.** They are authoritative, unlike the scrappy blog of some electronics hobbyist.
* **Unplug the AC power cable** before you start going at it with a screw driver.
* **Wait 5 minutes after unplugging the AC power cable**: the power supply unit of an HP 16500A 
  has a lot of large capacitors and does not have bleeder resistors to quickly discharge 
  them after power is removed.
* **The power switch on the front panel is not in fact a power switch.** It merely puts the device in a
  standby low(er) power state. There is a real power switch at the back of the device.
* **The HP 16500A power supply unit creates 120V DC to power the CRT module**. Most power supply 
  units only create relatively low DC voltages, this one does not. Be extra careful.
* **CRT tubes require voltages that can go above a 1000V**. I’m not totally sure 
  about this one, but the CRT schematic has annotations of 800V. 
* **Be extra careful about dropping screws.** There are a lot of them. If one drops, get it 
  out before moving on to the next one. You don't want specialty fireworks due to a screw
  induced short circuit!
* If you want to switch on the device while the covers are removed, **tape some 
  cardboard on top of the CRT unit** to prevent accidentally touching the high voltage parts.
* **Never EVER do any measurements inside the bowels of the CRT module** when it’s powered on. 
  Sony provided a lot of measurement test points on the outside PCBs. There is absolutely 
  no need to get inside.
* **Have a clean workspace.** My bench is usually a horrible mess, but I unclutter it for 
  projects like this.

# Powering it up

After powering up the device, you should see something like this on the boot screen:

![Boot Screen](/assets/hp16500a/blog/2_bootup_screen.jpg)

The HP 16500A has 2 floppy drivers, one in the front and one in the back, and other than some 
boot EPROMs, it has no other means to store its system software. So, in practice, you'll always
keep a system disk in the rear floppy drive. The floppy drive is not compatible with standard
floppy drives from the mid eighties: it's a special 600RPM Sony drive.


# Opening up the Logic Analyzer

Section VI of the service manual explains how to take the whole device apart to replace pretty 
much all larger components in case of failure. It's not particularly difficult to open it up,
but I have a bit of tradition of showing too much of the disassembly process than too little, 
and I'm not going to stop that here.

One of the first things to know is that almost all screws that keep everything together are
torx screws. And for one of the first steps, you need a torx screw driver than is quite long
and slim.
