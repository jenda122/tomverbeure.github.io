# Introduction

I recently became the proud owner of an HP 16500A logic analyzer for the low low price of $20.

![Logic Analyzer on Cart](/assets/hp16500a/blog/1_logic_analyzer_on_cart.jpg)

Or better, I'm now the owner of **two** HP 16500A logic analyzers, because the seller had a
whole pallet of them, and when you have a spare, you can afford to take more risks while
experimenting with them. The second one even came with an HP keyboard and mouse.

![Logic Analyzer on Cart with Cables and Keyboard](/assets/hp16500a/blog/1b_logic_analyzer_on_cart.jpg)

It's a mainframe design, with a 6 slot backplane that contains a Motorola 68000 based CPU system board
and 5 additional slots for various plug-in measurement cards. My 2 units 
came with an HP 16510A: an 80 channel 25MHz/100MHz digital acquisition card with a 4K 
acquisition depth, but higher performance cards exist. 

The logic analyzer functionality itself is not particularly useful for me: 
I never need to record that many channels in parallel, the acquisition depth is pathetic, 
the maximum sample rate is too low, and it's not trivial to get data of the machine for later analysis, 
because you need either use a non-standard floppy drive or the GPIB interface. It's also a huge, heavy 
beast that's impractical to move around on a bench, and you can't even disconnect the unwieldy
measurement cables that you don't use.

In short, this unit is worse in almost any respect than the [Saleae Logic Pro 16](https://www.saleae.com) 
that I use at work.

But it's always fun to take a vintage piece of electronics apart just for the sake
of it, learn about its special features, and maybe come up with some interesting
future project ideas?

So in this blog post, I'll take whole thing apart and try to figure out how what makes
it tick.

# Safety First

Before opening and working on this machine, it's import talk about safety: 

**WORKING ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULD KILL YOU.** 

There, I’ve said it. So, please, if you're not familiar with devices like this,
just read this blog for entertainment and don't try to reproduce my results.
If you decide to do it anyway, you do so at your risk, and take a number of 
basic precautions:

* **Read the [HP 16500A][HP 16500A Service Manual] and the [Sony CHM-9001-00][CHM-9001 Service Manual] 
  service manuals.** They are authoritative, unlike the scrappy blog of some electronics hobbyist.
* **Unplug the AC power cable** before you start going at it with a screw driver.
* **Wait 5 minutes after unplugging the AC power cable**: the power supply unit of an HP 16500A 
  has a lot of large capacitors and does not have bleeder resistors to quickly discharge 
  them after power is removed.
* **The power switch on the front panel is not in fact a power switch.** It merely puts the device in a
  standby low(er) power state. There is a real power switch at the back of the device.
* **The HP 16500A power supply unit creates 120V DC to power the CRT module**. Most power supply 
  units only create relatively low DC voltages, this one does not. Be extra careful.
* **CRT tubes require voltages that can go above a 1000V**. I’m not totally sure 
  about this one, but the CRT schematic has annotations of 800V. 
* **Be extra careful about dropping screws.** There are a lot of them. If one drops, get it 
  out before moving on to the next one. You don't want specialty fireworks due to a screw
  induced short circuit!
* If you want to switch on the device while the covers are removed, **tape some 
  cardboard on top of the CRT unit** to prevent accidentally touching the high voltage parts.
* **Never EVER do any measurements inside the bowels of the CRT module** when it’s powered on. 
  Sony provided a lot of measurement test points on the outside PCBs. There is absolutely 
  no need to get inside.
* **Have a clean workspace.** My bench is usually a horrible mess, but I unclutter it for 
  projects like this.

# Powering it up

*Taking pictures of running CRT screen is a pain, and they generally look terrible. Just assume that
whatever you see here will look much better to your eyes in real life.*

After powering up the device, you should see something like this on the boot screen:

![Boot Screen](/assets/hp16500a/blog/2_bootup_screen.jpg)

The HP 16500A has 2 floppy drives, one in the front and one in the back, and other than some 
boot EPROMs, it has no other means to store its system software. So, in practice, you'll always
keep a system disk in the rear floppy drive. The floppy drive is not compatible with standard
drives from the mid eighties: it's a special 600RPM Sony drive.

# Disassembly Tools

I've opened plenty of HP test and measurement devices, and so far, all I needed where regular
flat-head, Philips, and hexagonal screw drivers. Not so for the HP16500A: it uses Torx 10, 15,
and 20 screws everywhere. And even if you already have some of Torx heads that plug into a 
generic screwdriver, chances are that you still won't be able to open up the logic analyzer.

That's because you can't remove any of the 4 enclosing side panels without removing 4 feet
at the back. And each of those 4 feet has a Torx 10 screw sunken deep inside a narrow hole. 

![4 feet at the back of the logic analyzer](/assets/hp16500a/blog/3_back_with_4_feet.jpg)

The only way to get to it was with a dedicated, narrow, Trox screw driver, not a generic
one with exchangable heads.

![Trox 10 screwdriver sunk into a feet](/assets/hp16500a/blog/4_sunken_screwdriver.jpg)

One of the benefits of having many projects going on in parallel is that you can switch
to something else while an order for tools is on its way. 

![Set of Torx screwdrivers](/assets/hp16500a/blog/5_set_of_torx_screwdrivers.jpg)

*If you're going to route of buying a set, do yourself a favor and buy **security** Torx 
screwdrivers: they fit in the same holes are regular ones, but have an additional axial hole for security
Torx screws.*

# Tearing Down the Logic Analyzer

Section VI of the service manual explains how to take the whole device apart to replace pretty 
much all larger components in case of failure. It's not particularly difficult to open it up,
but I have a bit of tradition of showing too much of the disassembly process than too little, 
and I'm not going to stop that here.

**Remove the plug-in card and empty slot covers**

Let's start with that, because it's easy and all these annoying cables won't be in the way anymore.

Note that it's not possible to remove the CPU system card at the bottom, because not only does
the left bottom foot blocks it from sliding out, but also because there are a few flat cables,
accessible after removal of the bottom panel, must be unplugged first.

![Remove plug-in cards](/assets/hp16500a/blog/6_remove_plug_in_cards.jpg)

Here is the removed HP 16510A acquistion card:

![HP 16510A acquisition card](/assets/hp16500a/blog/7_16510a_acquisition_card.jpg)

These 5 heatsinks probably cover some custom ASICs, and are thus a bit of dead-end. I'll
leave them be. 

**Remove the 4 Feet in the back**

![4 feet at the back of the logic analyzer](/assets/hp16500a/blog/3_back_with_4_feet.jpg)

Yes, this is the same picture as above!

**Remove 3 back panel retention screws**

There isn't a 4th screw, because one side panels has a carrying handle and screws to keep in place.

![3 back panel retention screws](/assets/hp16500a/blog/8_back_panel_screws.jpg)

Whenever possible, I tape the screws to the place where they came from. That makes it so
much easier to assemble thing back together later.

![screw taped to the top panel next to the screw hole](/assets/hp16500a/blog/9_tape_screws_where_they_belong.jpg)

**Remove the handle from the side panel**

![side panel with handle](/assets/hp16500a/blog/10_side_panel_with_handle.jpg)

A friend was able to scavenge a few rolling equipment carts at work and gave me one.
These things are amazing when you need to remove screws from all sides of a 40 pounds heavy
box!

**Remove the top and side panels**

We can now remove the panels! You can slide each of the 4 panels from the front to the back,
but there can be quite a bit of friction. The easiest way is to remove the top panel first. 

Insert a flathead screwdriver in the gap between the back top panel and the back of the power
supply unit and rotate the screwdriver until the panel comes loose.

![Use screwdriver to loosen top panel](/assets/hp16500a/blog/11_use_screwdriver_to_loosen_top_panel.jpg)

You can now easily slide out the top panel.

![Sliding out the top panel](/assets/hp16500a/blog/12_slide_out_top_panel.jpg)

Since we already removed their back screws as well, it's possible that the side panels immediately
slide out too. If not, they should now be easy to slide out too.

You'll be greeted by the following glorious sight:

![Top of the logic analyzer exposed](/assets/hp16500a/blog/13_top_of_logic_analyzer_exposed.jpg)

We can see a huge power supply, the front and back floppy drives, and the CRT unit.

All of these will come out soon.

**Remove the bottom panel**

Let's turn the unit on its side and slide out the bottom panel.

![Bottom of the logic analyzer exposed](/assets/hp16500a/blog/14_bottom_of_logic_analyzer_exposed.jpg)

We now have access to all the main components.

**Remove the CPU controller board**

The video cable and the floppy drive cables are the only ones that connect directly to the CPU controller 
board. They're much easier to unplug now that the back panel has been removed. I also unplugged the 
frontpanel cable and the orange cooling fan control cable, but that's not necessary to remove the CPU board.

![Unplug CPU board cables](/assets/hp16500a/blog/15_unplug_cpu_board_cables.jpg)

After removing 2 screws in the back, we can slide out the CPU board. It looks really nice. 
Let's put it aside for now. We'll check it out more in detail later.
