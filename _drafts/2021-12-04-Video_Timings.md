    * VESA standards history: http://www1.ecs.uni-ruse.bg/kp/less/dispalys/VD-site/vesa/ve00005.html

        * August 1989 VESA Mode 6AH Graphics Standard: Defines consistent initialization numbers for 
          800 x 600, 16-color Super VGA, which allows programs to set this graphics mode on all Super VGA boards.

          VG901101: Documents the most common timing parameters in current monitor and board products running 
          1024 x 768 Super VGA at 60Hz. All products manufactured to VESA's 1024 x 768 / 60Hz guideline work together.

        * Earliest timings in the DMT standard are 800x600@56 and 60Hz: 8/6/90. (document VG900601 and VG900602)

        * DMT standard milestones in spec don't really match the one on the old website...
