# Introduction

Living in the Bay Area is not all roses, but one amazing benefit is the amount of electrical engineers
who are retiring, downsizing, and finally getting rid of their old test equipment. There's John,
who has my number on speed dial when he wants to get rid of signal generators, spectrum analyzers, and 
frequency counters. ("I know the price is way too low, but I don't want to sell who'd just put it on 
eBay"), and there's Lew who's similarly cleaning up his lab of old by extremely well maintained RF
equipment.

A few weeks ago, Lew posted not one by 2 HP 8007B pulse generators on Craiglist for a total of $50.
Granted, only one unit was working and the other for parts only. Lew had already tracked down the
failure to the output amplifier so it might be fixable, but that's for another time. 

Let's be clear: I have no use for a pulse generator, and before writing this blog post I didn't know 
what these things are normally used for either. 
[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_generator) tells me they are often used *to create a 
stimulus to analyze a device under test, confirm proper operation, or pinpoint a fault in a device*.

Still, for $50 it seems like a fun thing to play with, so I made the trek from Sunnyvale to 
Mountain View to pick up the two units.
